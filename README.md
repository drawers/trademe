#Instructions:

Add consumer key and consumer secret to `gradle.properties` in `$PROJECT_ROOT$`:

```
# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects
# org.gradle.parallel=true
consumer_key = "real consumer key"
consumer_secret = "real consumer secret"
```
